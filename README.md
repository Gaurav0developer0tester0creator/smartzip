# smartzip# SmartZip: Adaptive Compression Protocol (Protocol #1)

SmartZip is an **AI-driven adaptive compression and universal data protocol** for the decentralized AI internet.  
Unlike static compressors like gzip or zstd, SmartZip uses **machine learning** to analyze datasets and automatically choose the most efficient compression method.  

This reduces **storage and bandwidth costs** while preserving speed and privacy.

## ✨ Features
- 🔄 Adaptive ML-based compression (auto-selects best algo per dataset).  
- ⚡ Multi-algorithm support: gzip, bz2, lzma, lz4, zstd, brotli.  
- 📊 Benchmark framework (WIP) to compare algorithms across datasets.  
- 🛠️ Developer-friendly Python API + CLI (planned).  
- 🔒 Privacy-first design, ready for decentralized storage & AI pipelines.

## 🚀 Quick Example
```python
from smartzip.compressors import compress_zstd, decompress_zstd

data = b"Hello SmartZip Protocol! " * 100
compressed = compress_zstd(data)
restored = decompress_zstd(compressed)

print("Original size:", len(data))
print("Compressed size:", len(compressed))
print("Restored correct?", restored == data)
